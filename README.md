# phrakture.github.io

A static website containing trio of simple routines for improving flexibility and mobility.

## What this fork is for

### Background

I discovered the Molding Mobility and Starting Stretching routines here from the [fitness community on Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/fitness). I love these routines and am very grateful for this free resource. However, I personally have found it a little cumbersome to reference these pages when I'm actively trying to do the routines at the gym before or after a workout. This is mainly because I am viewing the pages on a (relatively) small smartphone screen, which causes some design issues and makes it annoying to switch back and forth between the main page and different links. I've also noticed the site hasn't been updated in four years, and as a result, some of the links no longer go anywhere useful (or they lead to pages with really obnoxious ads).

So, **the goal of this fork is to update the site content and add a more mobile-friendly design, without changing the core content**. While I may add or update reference material (external links, images, and videos), I will not be updating any of the actual text of the site, as I think Mister Griffin has done a fine job on all that.
